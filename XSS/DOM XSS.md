# DOM XSS
The third and final type of XSS is another Non-Persistent type called DOM-based XSS. While reflected XSS sends the input data to the back-end server through HTTP requests, DOM XSS is completely processed on the client-side through JavaScript. DOM XSS occurs when JavaScript is used to change the page source through the Document Object Model (DOM).
